You have been tasked to manage community library. It is a small library with 13 bookshelves.
As a computer science students, you were asked to develop a simple application to make
managing books (i.e. storing and searching) easier.
Using hash table as the main data structure to store book information, develop a prototype of
library management system to show proof of concept.
Assumption: Each shelf in the library represents one bucket of the hash table. Each book in the
library must be assigned with a unique identifier (e.g. book id).
Your prototype should contain the following functionalities:
1. Add a book into the hash table.
2. Search a particular book based on its identifier.
3. Display all books in ascending order of title.
Test your prototype using a menu-based console application with 10 sample data.
