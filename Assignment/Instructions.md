Develop a prototype for a music playlist using linked list data structure. Your prototype should contain the following functionalities.

1. Add new song into the playlist.
2. Display all songs in the playlist.
3. Remove a specific song from the playlist.
4. Playlist navigation (starting from the first song)

Test your prototype using a menu-based console application. Create a helper method to automatically add 10 songs upon execution of the program.
